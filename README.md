# GEODETIC CONVERSION TOOL

## Description
This is a tool used to convert geodetic coordinates from WGS 1984 to UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) and vice versa.
The program is written in Python 3.11.4 and compatible with Python 3.9 and above.

## DISCLAIMER
This program has been developed and tested as part of a class project. As such the test data used is largely of Kenya in the Zone 37S around Nairobi Area. There might be higher residuals as the program is not fully tested. The program is not to be used for any professional work. The author is not liable for any damages that may arise from the use of this program.

## Development Process
To develop a scientific program of this kind, mathematical basis is required to start with. This will include paper backed concepts as well as general assumptions about the conversion.
